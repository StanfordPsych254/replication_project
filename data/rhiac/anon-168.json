If there is a Heaven and a Hell, like the Bible says there is, then what could be more important. We save all of our lives for a few years of \"retirement\" and then die. If retirement is our goal and we actually live long enough to retire then we have a few years to relax and play but in the back of our minds we know that it is going to end all too soon. Then, even if we don't believe in an afterlife, we are facing the darkness of no longer being. As health problems arise as we age they are a reminder of our soon impending death. But if we accept Jesus as our Savior we know that death is just like falling asleep. We then get to spend eternity with those we love and our Creator who will have new and wonderful things for us to enjoy world without end.
