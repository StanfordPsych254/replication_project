I've written several well received books about films and filmmaking and my hope is that these books will remain on shelves in homes, stores and libraries for years after my passing. Of course, I would like to be remembered by friends and family as someone loyal and loving, but I feel the majority of people who remember my name after I'm in the ground will do so because of my writings. I hope these writings inspire people, inform people, educate people and encourage them to change how they think about films and filmmaking."], "sentence": ["", "", "", "", "", "Unplug appliances and chargers (e.g. TV, cell phone, computer) at night", "Take showers that are 5 minutes or less", "Use public transportation or carpool", "Write letters, email, phone or otherwise contact elected official to urge them to take action on environmental issues (e.g. habitat loss, air pollution)", "Attend rallies, public events or town hall meetings to voice my support for solving enviornmental problems", "Buy green products instead of regular products (e.g., dishwashing detergent), even though they cost more", "", "I feel a responsibility to reduce my personal contribution to climate change.", "I am in favor of national policies and regulations that decrease fossil fuel burning, even if they increase energy and electricity costs today.", "The so-called \"global warming crisis\" facing humanity has been greatly exaggerated", "I feel that it is important to maintain the environment for future generations.", "", "Others would say I have made unique contributions to my community or society", "I feel a connection to future generations", "I have important skills I can pass along to others", "I am well liked by my friends", "It is important to me to leave a positive legacy", "I feel a sense of responsibility to future generations", "I feel it is important for me to leave a positive mark on society", "I care what future generations think of me"], "year": ["30"], "totalHiddenTime": [null], "sex": ["male"], "race": ["white"], "purpose": ["I believe this study was about seeing how much people thought about what kind of planet we are going to leave for future generations."], "startTime": [1457570048038], "english": ["yes"], "grandparent": ["no"], "endTime": [1457570479220], "children": ["yes"], "condition": [1]}}, "AcceptTime": "2016-03-10T00:34:05Z", "HITId": "31D0ZWOD0AZ35XZ0LMC7H7MZ6GB0AS", "Assignment": "", "AssignmentStatus": "Approved", "SubmitTime": "2016-03-10T00:41:21Z"}
