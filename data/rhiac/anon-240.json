Being accepting of other people has been something that is very hard during this time, where some people are able to accept that others are different, and everyone else just wants life to be the same. This is an era for innovation, and I want to be seen as one of the people who was loving and accepting of all types of people, and wished for everyone to be respectful. I am a nurturing and caring mother, friend, and a strong woman too. Being a woman who wants true equality is a rarity in its form. Many \"feminists\" have a stigma surrounding them where they are asking for special favors rather than equality, but this is something that is also being observed by the African American community as well, and probably is not true, at least not for everyone. It is important tobe accepting of our rights to freedom and equality, but also to want true eqaulity rather than favoritism or special circumstances. Accepting these features in society will make a great step toward a brighter future, and I think that is something that I feel so strongly about I wouldlike to be remembered by it. I teach my child to be accepting, loving, caring, and respectful, and I would gladly teach others this as well. I truly believe this is the right way to treat other people, and I would love to abolish the close-minded and regressive habits, and move forward."], "sentence": ["", "", "", "", "", "Use public transportation or carpool", "Unplug appliances and chargers (e.g. TV, cell phone, computer) at night", "Attend rallies, public events or town hall meetings to voice my support for solving enviornmental problems", "Take showers that are 5 minutes or less", "Write letters, email, phone or otherwise contact elected official to urge them to take action on environmental issues (e.g. habitat loss, air pollution)", "Buy green products instead of regular products (e.g., dishwashing detergent), even though they cost more", "", "I feel that it is important to maintain the environment for future generations.", "I am in favor of national policies and regulations that decrease fossil fuel burning, even if they increase energy and electricity costs today.", "The so-called \"global warming crisis\" facing humanity has been greatly exaggerated", "I feel a responsibility to reduce my personal contribution to climate change.", "", "Others would say I have made unique contributions to my community or society", "I feel a sense of responsibility to future generations", "It is important to me to leave a positive legacy", "I care what future generations think of me", "I feel a connection to future generations", "I am well liked by my friends", "I have important skills I can pass along to others", "I feel it is important for me to leave a positive mark on society"], "year": ["27"], "totalHiddenTime": [0], "sex": ["female"], "race": ["white"], "purpose": ["Peoples thoughts about the future and how they are making the changes they want to see now"], "startTime": [1457568350830], "english": ["yes"], "grandparent": ["no"], "endTime": [1457568886664], "children": ["yes"], "condition": [1]}}, "AcceptTime": "2016-03-10T00:05:51Z", "HITId": "31D0ZWOD0AZ35XZ0LMC7H7MZ6GB0AS", "Assignment": "", "AssignmentStatus": "Approved", "SubmitTime": "2016-03-10T00:14:50Z"}
