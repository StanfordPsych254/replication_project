I was born into a very poor family in the South. My father was a farmer and my mother was a house wife. They raised eight kids with me being one of the middle children. I graduated from high school and moved to California and went to college. I worked while in school and progressed to a very good job at a utility company. I was able to purchase a home, send a daughter through college, take trips to other countries and retire at a young age. Although this was quite a few years ago, times are somewhat different today when it comes to getting a well-paying job even with a college degree. Many of those that graduated from high school in that small town in the south are still struggling to get by. There are many people that still cannot understand how I accomplished what I have accomplished. Hard work and perseverance means a lot.
