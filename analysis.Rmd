Libraries.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(tidyr)
```

Get project planning sheet and exclude those to be excluded. 

```{r}
project_plan_raw <- read_csv("data/planning_and_outcomes.csv")

project_plan <- project_plan_raw %>%
  filter(`include_in_final_writeup`==1) 
```

Read in project_info data from each project

```{r}
errors <- list()# Initialize an error var

all_project_info <- data.frame( # initialize an empty dataframe
  project_key = character()
)

project_keys <- project_plan$project_key # Find user names that are included in 

passing <- c("salehi","smraposo","jedtan","mkeil","jreynolds","jmarias","jsalloum","ehermann",
              "lampinen","auc")
failing <- c( "rhiac" )

# Run all respective R code - need loop because project_keys same variable name
for(project_key in passing) { # project_keys
  fp <- paste0("project_analyses/",project_key,".R")
  
  print(fp)
  tryCatch(source(fp), 
           error = function(e) {
             print(e)
             }
           ) 
  
  # If has project_info dataframe, add to all data
  if(exists("project_info")) { 
    all_project_info <- bind_rows(all_project_info,project_info) 
    rm("project_info") # In case other file does not same
  } else {
    errors <- c(errors,paste0(project_key," is missing project_info"))
  }
}
```
