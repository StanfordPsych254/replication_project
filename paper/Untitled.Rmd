  Results

Pedagogical assessment 

how many replications were conducted to the intended standard, how many opted out etc. 

Assessing the fidelity of replications to the original (in terms of same sample, same materials, same task parameters) 

Scientific Assessment

Indices of replicability 


Coding of previous yearsâ€™ findings

Discussion

Importance of self-selected papers - these are the papers that interesting to next generation of researchers

How to archive and make searchable the results of this sort of class?
OSF - but need search tools

## Subsection 1 
You can use R chunks directly to plot graphs.

```{r, graph, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=4, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Figure caption'}
require("ggplot2")
x <- 0:100
y <- 2 * (x + rnorm(length(x), sd = 3) + 3)
ggplot(data = data.frame(x, y), 
       aes(x = x, y = y)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```
